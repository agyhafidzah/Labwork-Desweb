	<h1><b>PTIK FKIP UNS</b></h1>
	<p>The <span id="pilih"> Faculty of Teacher Training and Education</span>, <span id="pilih">Sebelas Maret University</span>, Surakarta is an <span id="pilih">Educational Personnel Education Institution (LPTK)</span> which has 24 study programs in 6 majors. Each study program has its own characteristics in producing <span id="pilih">superior, strong, and intelligent educational staff.</span></p>
	<p>The <span id="pilih">Informatics and Computer Technology Education (PTIK)</span> study program is planned to take shelter in the management of the <span id="pilih">Engineering and Vocational Education (PTK)</span> department. This placement revises our previous statement, where are PTIK study program is under the P.MIPA department. PTIK is a study program that will produce graduates who are <span id="pilih">prioritized to teach in vocational/vocational programs.</span> So, it would be better if PTIK was under the PTK department which oversees vocational programs such as <span id="pilih">Building Engineering Education,</span> and <span id="pilih">Mechanical Engineering Education.</span> To meet the needs of lecturers in the field of information technology that cannot be met by the PTK department, PTIK will conduct <span id="pilih">resource sharing with the mathematics study program.</span></p>
